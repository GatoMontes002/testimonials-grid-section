              I received a job offer mid-course,
              and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the
              company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

              “ I was
              an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been
              looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
              amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
              found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
              weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
              completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working
              as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

              “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never
            written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals
            who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to
            enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful
            things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not
            disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for
            assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding.
            It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
            could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during
            interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly
            helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
            multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
